# comic_git
 A statically-hosted web comic server core intended to be hosted on github.io

To see an example of how a webpage looks, go to https://ryanvilbrandt.github.io/comic_git/

## Quickstart

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this page.
2. Name your repo, and enable GitHub Pages in settings.
3. Update `your_content/comic_info.json`.
4. Add folders in `your_content/comics` for each comic page you want to upload.
5. Run the batch script at `your_content/rebuild_directory_list.bat` (if you're on Linux, edit `directory_list.txt` directly or build your own script)
6. Commit your changes and push to GitHub.

More detailed setup instructions can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/ryanvilbrandt/comic_git/wiki).
